MRestraints is a simple set of scripts that output bond distances for a crystal structure as text in a format readbable via either CRYSTALS or SHELX.

To run MRestraints users require access to the full Cambridge Structural Database software package (with CSD Python API installed).

This program runs directly from MERCURY.

Install:
  1. Move the MRestraints folder to any local location with read/write access.
  2. Open MERCURY, and go into the python API drop down menu>Options and use "Add Location" to add the MRestraints folder address.
  3. Save changes, restart MECURY.
  4. The scripts should now be visable under the Python API drop down menu, and can be run by selecting them while any structure is open      in MERCURY.
  
NOTES:
- Output text files are found in the subfolder "Output Folder".
- Example output from CSD entries are included within this folder.
